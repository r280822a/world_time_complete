# World Time App, Completed
Forked from The Net Ninja's Flutter Beginners GitHub repo. 

The goal of this app is to complete the world time app that The Net Ninja made at the end of his playlist. By complete I mean adding all countries and their flags, as well as improving the user experience. <br/>
### APIs
This app makes use of 2 APIs: [TimeZoneDB](https://timezonedb.com/) for timezones, timestamps & country codes, and [Flagcdn](https://flagcdn.com/) for flag images. Both APIs are free for non-commercial use: [TimeZoneDB is under CC3](https://timezonedb.com/about), [Flagcdn is in the public domain](https://flagpedia.net/about)

## Features
- All timezones listed
- Appropriate flags for each timezone
- Timezones categorized into continents
- Time updates every second, on home screen
- Shows local timezone at first, on home screen
- Alert dialog showing error messages
- Internally store timezones after first call, allowing you to use the app offline after opening choose_location screen once
- Tap time to change to 24 hour format, and vice versa
- Info page showing credits and linking to this GitHub page

## TODO
- Loading screen for edit location (maybe?)
- Change overscroll (maybe?)
