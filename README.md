# World Time App, Completed
Forked from The Net Ninja's Flutter Beginners GitHub repo. 

The goal of this app is to complete the world time app that The Net Ninja made at the end of his playlist. By complete I mean adding all countries and their flags, as well as improving the user experience.

## Features
- All timezones listed
- Appropriate flags for each timezone
- Timezones categorized into continents
- Time updates every 30 seconds

## TODO
- Only send offset, so you only call API once then internally update time every couple of seconds
- Toast showing error messages
- Info page, showing credits, and linking to this GitHub page
- Tap time to change to 24 hour format
- Locally store timezones after first call
- Fix bugs when opening the app offline
- Loading screen for edit location (maybe?)
- Change overscroll (maybe?)
